  Wait, looking at "A revolucao dos bichos" card in uploaded_media_1:
  Top half is gray background with small book cover centered? 
  YES. It's not a full-bleed image cover. It's a "featured image" style.

     It seems Author is NOT explicitly shown on the card in the reference,

     I will keep Author at bottom or remove it if I want strict adherence. 
     User said "preciso ajustar essa tela" and showed the card with description.

  I'll hide it for now to match the "clean" look of the screenshot which is text-heavy description.
